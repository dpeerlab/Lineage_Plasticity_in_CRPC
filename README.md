# Lineage Plasticity in Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)
Enclosed is **scBLender**: a suite of quantitative measures of plasticity using the Basal-Luminal mixed phenotype as a proxy for plasticity based on time-course single-cell RNA sequencing data. We used these plasticity scores to identify gene programs enriched in cells with high plasticity. We followed this strategy to identify JAK-STAT inflammatory signaling as a driver of plasticity in prostate cancer; however, we envision generalizability in other cancer settings. 

Additionally, we provide **notebooks to generate figures** in Chan, et al. "Lineage plasticity in prostate cancer depends on JAK/STAT inflammatory signaling." Science, 2022.
